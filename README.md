# InvisibleFocus - VS Code Extension

A minimalist productivity extension for Visual Studio Code that enhances developer focus through ambient cues rather than disruptive timers, notifications, or popups.

## Features

- **Invisible Focus Timer**: Silent 50-minute focus sessions with gentle audio cues
- **Ambient Sound Panel**: Play looping ambient audio (forest, rain, café sounds)
- **Subtle Visual Cues**: Status bar indicator and background color shifts
- **Break Reminders**: Gentle notifications for rest periods

## Installation

1. Install the extension from the VS Code marketplace
2. Restart VS Code

## Usage

### Starting a Focus Session

1. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+P` (Mac)
2. Type "Start Focus Session" and press Enter
3. A gentle audio cue will play, and the status bar will show your session progress

### Ambient Sounds

1. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+P` (Mac)
2. Type "Open Ambient Sound Panel" and press Enter
3. Choose from available ambient sounds and control playback

## Configuration

The extension can be configured through VS Code's settings:

- `invisibleFocus.sessionDuration`: Duration of focus sessions in minutes (default: 50)
- `invisibleFocus.ambientSound`: Default ambient sound to play (options: forest, rain, cafe)

## Philosophy

InvisibleFocus is built on the belief that deep work should be supported, not interrupted. By reducing cognitive noise and enhancing the workspace through ambient stimuli, it helps developers enter and remain in flow state — the optimal zone for deep, creative work.
